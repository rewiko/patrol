PATROL GUI 3D TODO AND PROBLEMS
###############################

In the code there are several comments about what there is to do, here a brief of the principal:

-)Fix bugs about clash (Connection refused almost every time a player's ship meet an enemy
    ship or an enemy planet);
-)When the problems of the clash will be resolved, it will be necessary to build a window 
    to select the defence in case of attack to our planets. It can look at the files of the 
    purchase windows, like examples;
-)Change handling of the defence, every planet must have its defence, they shouldn't 
    be globals (this it can be done at PATROL level or at GUI level);
-)The number of defence of the planet shown in the GUI (at bottom, first line, last number 
    on the right) is not correct at this time. It is corrett only for not conquered planets 
    (-) and for the home planet at the beginning (1).
-)When the problems about clash will be resolved, the system of the clash may it be changed, 
    so the clash starts only when the resources are near (problems related to the render of 
    the enemy starships because they come out and go back inside the fog of war, this should 
    be the meaning of  the property of RTSGameGUI enemyShipMap that now is unused, it should 
    track the ships and their visibilty);
-)The grid, maybe, can be removed and this should allow to click everywhere (problems about
    number formats, PATROL use float but now we use float with integer number, and step of 
    the coordinates);
